The JayDeBeApi module allows you to connect from Python code to
databases using Java `JDBC
<http://java.sun.com/products/jdbc/overview.html>`_. It provides a
Python DB-API_ v2.0 to that database.

It works on ordinary Python (cPython) using the JPype_ Java
integration or on `Jython <http://www.jython.org/>`_ to make use of
the Java JDBC driver.

In contrast to zxJDBC from the Jython project JayDeBeApi let's you
access a database with Jython AND Python with only minor code
modifications. JayDeBeApi's future goal is to provide a unique and
fast interface to different types of JDBC-Drivers through a flexible
plug-in mechanism.

Install
=======

You can get and install JayDeBeApi with `pip <http://pip.pypa.io/>`_ ::

    $ pip install JayDeBeApi

If you want to install JayDeBeApi in Jython make sure to have pip or
EasyInstall available for it.

Or you can get a copy of the source by cloning from the `JayDeBeApi
github project <https://github.com/baztian/jaydebeapi>`_ and install
with ::

    $ python setup.py install

or if you are using Jython use ::

    $ jython setup.py install

It has been tested with Jython 2.7.2.

If you are using cPython ensure that you have installed JPype_
properly. It has been tested with JPype1 0.6.3 and 0.7.5 for Python 3 and
with JPype1 0.6.3 and 0.7.0 for Python 2.7. Older JPype
installations may cause problems.

Usage
=====

Basically you just import the ``jaydebeapi`` Python module and execute
the ``connect`` method. This gives you a DB-API_ conform connection to
the database.

The first argument to ``connect`` is the name of the Java driver
class. The second argument is a string with the JDBC connection
URL. Third you can optionally supply a sequence consisting of user and
password or alternatively a dictionary containing arguments that are
internally passed as properties to the Java
``DriverManager.getConnection`` method. See the Javadoc of
``DriverManager`` class for details.

The next parameter to ``connect`` is optional as well and specifies
the jar-Files of the driver if your classpath isn't set up
sufficiently yet. The classpath set in ``CLASSPATH`` environment
variable will be honored. See the documentation of your Java runtime
environment.

Here is an example:

>>> import jaydebeapi
>>> conn = jaydebeapi.connect("org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver",
...                           "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:.",
...                           driver_args=["SA", ""],
...                           jars="/path/to/hsqldb.jar",)
>>> curs = conn.cursor()
>>> curs.execute('create table CUSTOMER'
...              '("CUST_ID" INTEGER not null,'
...              ' "NAME" VARCHAR(50) not null,'
...              ' primary key ("CUST_ID"))'
...             )
>>> curs.execute("insert into CUSTOMER values (?, ?)", (1, 'John'))
>>> curs.execute("select * from CUSTOMER")
>>> curs.fetchall()
[(1, u'John')]
>>> curs.close()
>>> conn.close()

If you're having trouble getting this work check if your ``JAVA_HOME``
environment variable is set correctly. For example I have to set it on
my Ubuntu machine like this ::

    $ JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk python

An alternative way to establish connection using connection
properties:

>>> conn = jaydebeapi.connect("org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver",
...                           "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:.",
...                           driver_args={'user': "SA", 'password': "",
...                            'other_property': "foobar"},
...                           jars="/path/to/hsqldb.jar",)

Also using the ``with`` statement might be handy:

>>> with jaydebeapi.connect("org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver",
...                         "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:.",
...                         driver_args=["SA", ""],
...                         jars="/path/to/hsqldb.jar",) as conn:
...     with conn.cursor() as curs:
...         curs.execute("select count(*) from CUSTOMER")
...         curs.fetchall()
[(1,)]

Supported databases
===================

In theory *every database with a suitable JDBC driver should work*. It
is confirmed to work with the following databases:

* SQLite
* Hypersonic SQL (HSQLDB)
* IBM DB2
* IBM DB2 for mainframes
* Oracle
* Teradata DB
* Netezza
* Mimer DB
* Microsoft SQL Server
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* many more...
